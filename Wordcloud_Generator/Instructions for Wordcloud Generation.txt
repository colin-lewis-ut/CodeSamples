I used wordclouds.com for the level of customization it offers.

If you are using the same input files as I used, you can find the exact
lists under "Submitted Wordcloud Lists." Just copy & paste the text into 
the first text field that appears under "wordlist" on wordclouds.com

Position:
Copy input into a file titled "PositionInput.txt" in the same directory as
"positioncloudparcer.py", then run the parcer. You may need to check for
stray formatting characters that persisted through the filter.

Description:
The Descriptionparser proved ineffective, so most fomatting needs to be done
through word. "DescritpionInput.txt" has already been formatted, but if you
want to use updated data, you can recreate this formatting by using word's
find and replace function to replace dates, Bank names, and formatting 
symbols with blank characters. Finally, convert the full document to 
"Capitalize Each Word", the feed to the website.

Using wordcloud.com:
Wordlist: Use the paste option to use our formatted data. Shape, font, & 
color are self explanatory. However, when the cloud is generated, a box 
will appear in the top left corner of the screen informing you that some
words were not included. The size of words in the cloud can be adjusted 
using the slider at the top. The clouds I provided use -65 and -5, so this
parameter can require some fine tuning. Finally, the circulat arrow between
widen gaps and invert will allow you to customize the slant of the text.
